## Testing Notes:
The unit testing framework is defined in better detail than I will describe here: http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/2.4.3/guide/testing.html
Spock (what grails uses) is defined here: https://code.google.com/p/spock/wiki/SpockBasics


My basic methodology is to enter the prompt by typing “grails” and then type

    test-app :unit-test

This runs ALL of the tests in “test/unit” If you want to test a specific function then write it something like this:

    test-app org.bbop.apollo.FeatureService :unit 

This runs the tests in FeatureServiceSpec . . some of which is below.  Some important points:

1. @Mock includes any domain objects you’ll use.  Unit tests don’t use the database.
2. setup() is run for each test I believe 
3. when: “” then: “”   You have to have both or it is not a test. 
4. Notice the valid groovy notation  .name == “Chr3”, it implies the Java .equals() function . . everywhere . . . . groovy rox

```
    @TestFor(FeatureService)
    @Mock([Sequence,FeatureLocation,Feature])
      class FeatureServiceSpec extends Specification {
      void setup(){}
      void "convert JSON to Feature Location"(){
    
      when: "We have a valid json object"
      JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject()
      Sequence sequence = new Sequence(name: "Chr3",seqChunkPrefix: "abc",seqChunkSize: 20,start:1,end:100,length:99).save(failOnError: true)
      jsonObject.put(FeatureStringEnum.FMIN.value,73)
      jsonObject.put(FeatureStringEnum.FMAX.value,113)
      jsonObject.put(FeatureStringEnum.STRAND.value, Strand.POSITIVE.value)

    
      then: "We should return a valid FeatureLocation"
      FeatureLocation featureLocation = service.convertJSONToFeatureLocation(jsonObject,sequence)
      assert featureLocation.sequence.name == "Chr3"
      assert featureLocation.fmin == 73
      assert featureLocation.fmax == 113
      assert featureLocation.strand == Strand.POSITIVE.value
    } }
```

There are 3 “special” types of things to test, which are all important and reflect the grails special functions: Domains, Controllers, Services.  They will all be in the “test” directory and all be suffixed with “Spec” for a Spock test.
