### Tomcat memory

View <a href="https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md">On GitHub</a>


In many ocassions the default memory allowance is too low. The memory requirements of Web Apollo will depend on the the size of your genome and how many instances of Web Apollo you host in the same Tomcat instance, but in general, we recommend at least 1g for the heap size and 256m for the PermGen size as a starting point. Suggested settings are:

    export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1g -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

In cases where the assembled genome is highly fragmented, additional tuning of memory requirements and garbage collection will be necessary to maintain the system stable. Below is an example from a research group that maintains over 40 Apollo instances with assemblies that range from 1,000 to 150,000 scaffolds (reference sequences):  

    "-Xmx12288m -Xms8192m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=64m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Xloggc:$CATALINA_HOME/logs/gc.log -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps"

To use this setting, edit the setenv.sh script in 
`$TOMCAT_BIN_DIR/setenv.sh` where `$TOMCAT_BIN_DIR` is where the directory where the Tomcat binaries reside.

Conversely, you may have to edit `catalina.sh` directly to inject the options.

#### Confirm your settings

`ps -ef | grep -i tomcat`

You should see your memory settings in the command that runs tomcat.   

`/usr/local/bin/java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx2048M -Xms64M -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m `

#### A clean install

If you start seeing memory leaks (`java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`) after doing an update, try this.  Hot deploy is not recommended as it often leads to memory leaks or an inconsistent software state.  Instead I recommend a clean install, which is guaranteed to work.   

If you war file is named 'mywar.war'

- `apollo deploy`  (or `apollo release` if you have the proper libraries installed)
- stop tomcat
- `sudo rm -f $TOMCAT_WEBAPPS_DIR/webapps/mywar.war && sudo rm -rf $TOMCAT_WEBAPPS_DIR/webapps/mywar`
- `sudo cp target/apollo-XXX.war $TOMCAT_WEBAPPS_DIR/webapps/mywar.war`
- start tomcat 

### Tomcat permissions

When deploying your war file to tomcat or another web application server, you may run into permissions problems in your annotations directory or your web application directory.   Tomcat on many production systems will typically belong to a user and group called something like 'tomcat'.    Make sure that that user can read in the tomcat "webapps" directory (where you placed your war file) and write into the annotations and any other relevant directory (e.g. tomcat/logs).   As such, it is sometimes helpful to add the user you logged-in as to the same group as your tomcat user and set group write permissions for both.

### Getting logged out when entering JBrowse

This often indicates that the add-webapollo-plugin.pl script wasn't run properly, which will update JBrowse's configuration and load the Web Apollo plugin. See the [data generation](Data_loading.md) for details on this step.


### Errors running JBrowse scripts

##### e.g. "Can't locate Hash/Merge.pm in @INC" or "Can't locate JBlibs.pm in @INC"

If are trying to run the jbrowse binaries but get these sorts of errors, try `install_jbrowse.sh` which will initialize as many pre-requisites as possible including JBLibs and other JBrowse dependencies. 

### Errors during apollo deploy or install_jbrowse.sh

##### e.g. "cd: src/main/webapp/jbrowse: No such file or directory"

If you get this error, then you may need to re-run `apollo deploy` or even do a `apollo clean-all && apollo deploy`.


### Differences between JBrowse and WebApollo

The "linkTemplate" track configuration parameter in JBrowse is overridden by WebApollo's feature edge matcher and drag and drop functions. It is recommended to use menuTemplate instead.

### Complaints about 8080 being in use

Please check that you don't already have a tomcat running ``netstat -tan | grep 8080``.  
Sometimes tomcat does not exit properly.  ``ps -ef | grep java`` and then ``kill -9`` the offending processing.

### Unable to open the h2 / default database for writing

```
SEVERE: Unable to create initial connections of pool.
org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Error opening database: "Could not save properties /var/lib/tomcat7/prodDb.lock.db" [8000-176]
```

This is due to the production server trying to write an h2 instance in an area it doesn't have permissions to.
If you use H2 (which is great for testing or single-user user, but not for full-blown production) make sure that:

- you can write to the specified data directory for production.  Here is the default from ```DataSource.groovy```:

            url = "jdbc:h2:/tmp/prodDb;MVCC=TRUE;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE"
            
which will write a db file to ```/tmp/prodDB.db```.  If you don't specify an absolute path it will try to write in the same directory
that tomcat is running in e.g., ``/var/lib/tomcat7/``.

The solution is to copy over one of the ``sample-XXX-config.groovy`` files to ``apollo-config.groovy`` in your home directory and configure for your needs.
