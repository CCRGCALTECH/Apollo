## Basic configuration

Web Apollo 2.0 simplifies and expands options for the database setup. This section will cover the basic options for this.

## Database options


#### Configure for H2:
- copy sample-h2-apollo-config.groovy to apollo-config.groovy and update the data directory

#### Configure for PostgreSQL:
- Create a new database (e.g. default is just named `apollo`)
- Copy sample-postgres-apollo-config.groovy to apollo-config.groovy and re-run apollo deploy
- Note: There is no need to run the old add-tracks/add-users/set-track-permissions pipeline now.

#### Configure for MySQL:
- Create a new database (e.g. apollo by default)
- Copy sample-mysql-apollo-config.groovy to apollo-config.groovy and re-run apollo deploy


## Deploy the code as a war file
- ./apollo deploy
- copy the war file at target/apollo-X.Y.war to your webapps folder as apollo.war or similar


### Login to the web interface

After deployment, you can navigate to your server at http://localhost:8080/apollo/ or similar path and you will be
prompted for login information
